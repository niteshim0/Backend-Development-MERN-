# User Registration Process

## 1. Get user details from frontend:

Receive user details such as username, email, password, and avatar from the frontend.

## 2. Validation:

- Validate each field to ensure they are not empty and meet the required criteria.
- Perform additional validation based on your specific requirements, such as password strength or email format.

## 3. Check for existing user:

Query the database to check if the user already exists based on the provided username or email.

## 4. Check for images and avatar:

Ensure that images and avatars are provided, as they are required fields.

## 5. Upload images to Cloudinary:

- Upload user images, including the avatar, to a cloud storage service like Cloudinary.
- Handle any errors that might occur during the upload process.

## 6. Create User object and database entry:

- Create a User object with the validated user details, including the cloud storage URLs for the images.
- Insert the user details into the database.

## 7. Remove sensitive information:

Remove sensitive information such as the password and any refresh tokens from the response before sending it back to the frontend.

## 8. Check for successful user creation:

- Verify that the user was successfully created in the database.
- Handle any errors that may occur during the user creation process.

## 9. Return response:

- Return a response to the frontend, indicating the success or failure of the registration process.
- Include any relevant information or error messages in the response.

## 10. Additional considerations:

- Implement proper error handling at each step to provide meaningful error messages.
- Ensure secure practices such as hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
- Implement logging to track any unexpected issues during the registration process.
