# Learning Backend Development with JavaScript

## Introduction
Backend development is a crucial aspect of web development, responsible for server-side operations, data processing, and communication with databases. While it's not tied to a specific programming language, JavaScript is commonly used in the backend through frameworks like Node.js. Here's a simplified guide to learning backend development with a focus on JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
To get started with backend development, you need to understand two main components:
1. **Programming Language:** Choose a programming language such as JavaScript (Node.js), Java, Python, Go, or C++. Each language has its own frameworks for backend development.
2. **Database:** Learn about databases like MongoDB, Postgres, or SQLite. Also, explore Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools (e.g., Prisma for TypeScript, Mongoose for JavaScript) for easier interaction with databases.

## Basics of Backend Development
1. **Processing and Storing Data:**
   - Backend development involves processing, verifying, and storing data in a database.
   - Use frameworks like Express for routing in JavaScript-based backend development.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - Respond to queries by retrieving data from the database and presenting it as API responses (usually in JSON format).

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Deploy backend code on multiple servers to achieve load balancing and improve performance.

4. **Database Location:**
   - Databases can be located on servers in different continents for global accessibility.

## JavaScript-based Backend Development
1. **Runtime Environments:**
   - Focus on JavaScript runtime environments like Node.js. Other options include Deno and Bun.
   - In the starting time, the backend in JS is analogous to learning Node.js since it is the only available JavaScript runtime environment (JRE) for a more extended period. Learning Node.js provides advantages, but it's essential to note that Node.js is not synonymous with backend development. Some misconceptions may arise due to a lack of knowledge or attempts to make courses more comprehensive by some greedy Indian YouTubers.


2. **Key Components:**
   - Utilize Express for routing and Mongoose for database interaction in JavaScript-based backend development.

3. **Handling Data:**
   - Backend in JavaScript deals with three main types of data: user data (e.g., username, password), files (e.g., images, videos), and third-party APIs (e.g., Google Login,Github Login, AWS).

## File Structure
1. **src Directory:**
   - Contains essential files and folders.
     - `index.js` or `main.js`: Entry point and database connection.
     - `App.js`: Configuration, routing, cookies, and URL encoding.
     - `constants`: Store constants like DB names and enums(option giver).

2. **Directory Structure:**
   - Organize code into specific directories:
     - `DB`: Database connection code.
     - `Models`: Data models for defining how data is stored.
     - `Controllers`: Methods or functions for processing data.
     - `Routes`: Define routes and specify authorization.
     - `Utils`: Utility functions like mail sender and file uploader.
     - `More`: Additional directories based on specific use cases.
